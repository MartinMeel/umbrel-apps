  qBittorrent is a cross-platform free and open-source BitTorrent client
  The qBittorrent project aims to provide an open-source software alternative to µTorrent.

  Additionally, qBittorrent runs and provides the same features on all major platforms (FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, OS/2, Windows).

  qBittorrent is based on the Qt toolkit and libtorrent-rasterbar library.

  ⚠️ This version needs a Gluetun container where the ports are defined for qBittorrent to work
  ⚠️ To find the password just push the troubleshoot buttun and search for the password in the first lines.
