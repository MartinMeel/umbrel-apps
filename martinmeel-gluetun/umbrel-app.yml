tagline: Lightweight VPN client with support for multiple providers
description: >-
  Gluetun is a lightweight VPN client written in Go that supports multiple VPN providers
  including Windscribe. It acts as a VPN gateway for other Docker containers, allowing
  them to route their traffic through the VPN connection.
  
  
  This setup is pre-configured for Windscribe but supports many other providers. Other
  containers can route their traffic through Gluetun by using its network stack.
  
  
  Key features:
  
  - Support for multiple VPN providers (Windscribe, NordVPN, ExpressVPN, etc.)
  
  - Built-in firewall with kill switch
  
  - DNS over TLS (DoT) support
  
  - HTTP proxy server
  
  - Health monitoring and automatic reconnection
  
  - Port forwarding support (provider dependent)
  
  
  Before installing, make sure you have your Windscribe credentials ready. You'll need
  to configure WINDSCRIBE_USERNAME and WINDSCRIBE_PASSWORD in the app settings.
releaseNotes: >-
  Initial release with Windscribe support. Configured to allow other containers
  to route through the VPN connection.
