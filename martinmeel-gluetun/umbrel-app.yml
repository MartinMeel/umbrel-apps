tagline: Lightweight VPN client with support for multiple providers
description: >-
  Gluetun is a lightweight VPN client written in Go that supports multiple VPN providers
  including Windscribe. It acts as a VPN gateway for other Docker containers, allowing
  them to route their traffic through the VPN connection.

  This setup is pre-configured for Windscribe but supports many other providers. Other
  containers can route their traffic through Gluetun by using its network stack.

  Key features:
  - Support for multiple VPN providers (Windscribe, NordVPN, ExpressVPN, etc.)
  - Built-in firewall with kill switch
  - DNS over TLS (DoT) support
  - HTTP proxy server
  - Health monitoring and automatic reconnection
  - Port forwarding support (provider dependent)
  
  IMPORTANT:
  Before installing, make sure you have your ProtonVPN credentials ready. You'll need
  to configure PROTONVPN_PRIVATE_KEY in the exports.sh file.
  Gluetun provides an HTTP API (not a web UI) for
  monitoring at port 8000. Use curl or other tools to interact with the API.
  
  CHECKS:
