  Radarr is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds
  for new movies and will interface with clients and indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also
  be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when a better quality
  format becomes available.
  
  This version routes all traffic through Gluetun VPN for privacy and security.
