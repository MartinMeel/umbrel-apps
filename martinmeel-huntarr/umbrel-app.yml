  🔄 Connect & Analyze - Huntarr connects to your Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr/Readarr/Whisparr/Eros instances and analyzes your media libraries to identify both missing content and potential quality upgrades.

  Hunt Missing Content - Efficiently refreshes by skipping metadata to reduce disk I/O and database load, automatically skips content with future release dates, provides precise control over how many items to process per cycle, and focuses only on content you've marked as monitored.

  Hunt Quality Upgrades - Finds content below your quality cutoff settings for improvement, uses batch processing to set specific numbers of upgrades per cycle, automatically pauses when download queue exceeds your threshold, and waits for commands to complete with consistent timeouts.

  API Management - Implements hourly caps to prevent overloading your indexers, uses consistent API timeouts (120s) across all applications, identifies as Huntarr to all Arr applications with consistent headers, and provides visual indicators showing API usage limits.

  Repeat & Rest - Huntarr waits for your configured interval (adjustable in settings) before starting the next cycle, ensuring your indexers aren't overloaded while maintaining continuous improvement of your library.

  Made a logic fix for Sonarr regarding air date delay. Will show if either or both episode mode is selected for missing and/or upgrades. Prior, would disappear if both were not in episode mode.
