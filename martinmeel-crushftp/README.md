Note: To mount the CrushFTP11 folder locally using Docker Compose, it will be mounted by default as the root user. To update the permissions of the local host volume, you can run the command sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -u) /home/umbrel/umbrel/app-data/martinmeel-crushftp/CrushFTP11. 
This command will update the permissions of the CrushFTP11 folders to use your local running user, making it easier to edit files. Otherwise, you will need to edit them with the root user on the local host machine.
