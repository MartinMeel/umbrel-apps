  CrushFTP is filled full of features. Features you might not use right away, 
  but eventually as your business grows you'll wonder if it can handle a new task. 
  Usually, the feature is already there, just waiting for you to explore and use it!
  First time users will be up and running in no time, and power users 
  won't be disappointed with a lack of options, controls, or functionality.

releaseNotes: >-
  1st release for umbrel

  WebInterface
  The entire end user view of the WebInterface has been rewritten from scratch. 
  This was a major undertaking and one of the main reasons for the wait. 
  It was a massive undertaking to rewrite all that code and UI design that had grown for 14+ years. 
  The key item we did here is we removed jQuery from end user usage 100%. 
  So now everything is our own code and CSS. The UI is *much* faster, and can handle *much* larger 
  directory listings etc. We have full control over everything now as well.
